# NetNFI
NetNFi is a lightweight, open source network data extraction tool. NetNFI extracts IP network information from a linux guest or host. This standalone tool replaces / augments several older tools such as the linux ip command to deliver consistent data that can be included in system configuration, docker, and Kubernetes controls. NetNFI is built from the ground up to be "docker aware" and can use sitewide configuration data to control the application behavior across large groups of hosts.
